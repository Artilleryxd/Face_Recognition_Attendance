BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION GUIDE
=============================================

By default, the system runs in SIMULATION MODE, which does not require webcam access.
This allows you to test the system's functionality without a webcam.

TO TOGGLE BETWEEN WEBCAM AND SIMULATION MODE:
---------------------------------------------

1. Open the file: app.py

2. Find this line (around line 20):
   
   # Configuration
   USE_WEBCAM = False  # Set to False to use simulation mode instead of webcam

3. To use a real webcam:
   Change to: USE_WEBCAM = True
   
   To use simulation mode (no webcam required):
   Keep as: USE_WEBCAM = False

4. Save the file and restart the application.

TROUBLESHOOTING WEBCAM ACCESS:
------------------------------

If you're using webcam mode and see "Camera access denied":

1. Mac users:
   - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Camera
   - Ensure your terminal or Python app has permission to access the camera

2. Windows users:
   - Go to Settings > Privacy > Camera
   - Ensure "Allow apps to access your camera" is ON

3. Other issues:
   - Ensure no other applications are using your webcam
   - Try restarting your computer
   - Check that your webcam is properly connected and functioning

If you continue to have webcam access issues, you can always use simulation mode to test the system.
